				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with any trade, there’s a huge variance in the quality of service in the gas industry. You have those willing to go the extra mile and guarantee a top-tier job, and then those who do the absolute bare minimum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing and being confident in your work’s value is essential for gas engineers. We all know that pricing strategy plays a hugely important role in the success of your heating &amp; plumbing business (read more about that here). But there’s more to it than the numbers: The confidence in your work and being able to justify costs to your customers are two important parts of the game. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spoke about the topic with Luke Stanyer, the owner of Blue Bulldog Plumbing &amp; Heating. Read on to hear what he had to say as well as 7 ways you can justify your prices. </span></div>
			</div>
			</div>
				
				
				
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_1 et_pb_equal_columns">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>How to know your worth</b></h2></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 fluid-text  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the most part, prices reflect quality &#8211; but it’s not always that simple. It can feel like a race to the bottom when it comes to pricing strategy, with gas engineers going lower than they’d like out of the fear of not getting enough work. But it’s a double edged sword, as lower prices and more work mean you have less time &#8211; and quality often suffers as a result.</span></div>
			</div>
			</div>
				
				
				
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_2 et_pb_equal_columns">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_2  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h3><b>Recognising the value of your experience &amp; craftsmanship</b></h3></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4 fluid-text  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas engineers who have all the experience, skills, and effort necessary for a good job have happier customers, get fewer callbacks, and complete safer gas systems. For all these reasons, gas engineers of this calibre should feel able to charge a premium. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difficulty is that these engineers are not always able to convey the value of their experience &amp; craftsmanship. Luke was faced with this experience himself at one point: “I can walk into a job and know what’s wrong and have it fixed really quick”, he said &#8211; but the customer then questioned why his prices were so high if the job was so quick. Luke put it best when he said “It took me 15 years to do it in 5 minutes”. It’s his experience and result he’s charging for, not how long he was there for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They could have easily found a cheaper company, but they would have taken much longer and ended up charging a similar rate anyway. “I shouldn’t be penalised for that” he adds, explaining to the customer how his experience and skill affects his pricing. </span></div>
			</div>

			</div><div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_3 et_pb_equal_columns">

			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6 fluid-text  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luke also understands and respects the effort he puts into each job: “In this trade, you can’t just walk away from a job. If they’ve got no water, you’ve gotta stay until they’ve got water. Or if you’ve taken out the toilet….” he explains. To him, it’s important to always give a job his best: “I&#8217;ll always give 110%”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is never more evident than when he walks into a property with shoddy work done before him. </span></div>
			</div>
			</div>
				
				
				
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_4 et_pb_equal_columns">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_4  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h3><b>Comparing yourself to the competition</b></h3></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_8 fluid-text  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From his years as a gas engineer, Luke has had more than his fair share of experiences with shoddy work. “The worst is walking in after someone who’s generally a cowboy”, notes Luke. Describing one experience in particular, he says “nothing was level, the toilet and the basin were a mess, and we had to rip it all out and start again”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My problem is I’m not cheap compared to some people”, says Luke. “There are people around me that are cheaper, but when I walk in afterwards and see the work…it’s all wonky, or they’ve put so many joints in, not bothered to get the benders out… it’s just little things like that. And you think if they’d done a little bit extra, it would have looked better and worked better”, he elaborates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jobs like these can be an absolute nightmare, but it should at the very least help build confidence in your pricing and craftsmanship. If you do better work, you should charge accordingly. </span></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers can’t be blamed for not understanding the complexities of a job, but you should do your best to communicate your value to anyone you’re hoping to work with. They need to understand the benefits of working with a skilled engineer if they are to choose to work with you instead of the cheapest option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several different strategies you can take to justify costs:</span></p></div>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Be transparent with your pricing. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A huge portion of customers are sceptical about “high” prices simply because they don’t understand what goes into them. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Highlight and showcase your quality of work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This can be done through marketing, case studies, or simply as you speak to customers over the phone. The goal is to give customers a clear picture of what they’re paying for, and what they can expect (which is incredibly important for customers careful with money).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Ask for reviews</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This will help potential customers see that those who’ve previously worked with you value your work. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Explain the long-term benefit of getting a quality job done.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Quality work should mostly speak for itself, but you can also explain that they may end up spending more in the long run if work isn’t done to a standard that will last.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Prioritise customer relationships</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Customers that feel valued and appreciated will be more likely to spend a little more.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Use premium materials. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might be less relevant for boilers, but all the piping and any plumbing work you should have materials to match your craftsmanship. </span></li>

<p><b></b><b>For repeat work and with a little bit of effort, your work will justify its own cost. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you get your foot in the door with a first job, your quality craftsmanship, hassle-free customer service, and anything else will help encourage repeat business. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s lots at play when running a successful heating and plumbing business, but pricing strategy is crucial. It can feel like there is a constant pressure to lower prices just to remain competitive, but this ends up with companies struggling to meet their bottom line, cramped schedules, and a lack of free time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From our experience and having spoken to Luke, it’s clear that there’s two problems at hand: knowing the value of your work, and justifying its cost to customers. Finding a solution to both offers a healthy business cycle where your profits are enough to drive growth and success. </span></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can take running a business to fully appreciate how many different steps a job has from start to finish. What all starts with a simple call can turn into a quote, an entry in your schedule, a day’s hard work, an invoice, and finally record filing. Customers only see the hands-on work, but being a gas engineer means a multi-step process that includes lots of planning and paperwork too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This plays a huge part in why so many <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/blog/finding-a-work-life-balance-as-a-solo-gas-engineer/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gas engineers struggle to find a proper work-life balance</a>. With so many different steps to each job, it can all feel like a disjointed and mundane process with time wasted at every stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With software having firmly cemented itself in the industry this past decade, it’s not uncommon to see gas engineers using different apps to help them create <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/records-certificates/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gas safety certificates</a>, <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/estimate-quotes-invoices/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">invoices</a>, and so on. But what these apps don’t help with is connecting each part of the process together. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/customer-relationship-management/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Customer information.</a></p>
<p>If you’re creating all these elements of a job manually (whether on paper or in software), you’re doubling up on data-entry for no good reason.</p>
<p>With an all-in-one software package, data is shifted seamlessly across these different stages of the job. For example, creating an invoice is incredibly quick when the software already knows what the job consisted of from the quote, and already has all the customer details stored. Similarly, chunks of your gas safe certificates, quotes (for existing customers), and more will be pre-filled with data pulled from your database of customer information. In the long run, this will help you save hours of time and countless headaches.</p>
<p>Not to mention, a workflow like this makes tax season much less stressful. Everything is kept organised and in one place.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Building on point #1, having to switch between different apps or software for your certificates, invoices, and scheduling is time consuming at best. It’s not uncommon for gas engineers to be working with 3-5 different apps throughout their entire workflow, and there’s several problems with this:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 13px;">You’ve got to learn how to use all these different apps.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 13px;">There’s a greater chance to run into bugs and software issues with so many different platforms.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 13px;">The constant switching may only take a few seconds each time, but it can build up and is frustrating. This is especially true if you’re running a paper-software hybrid workflow.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 13px;">Several different software subscriptions are normally more expensive than a single, all-in-one system.</li>
<li>All those passwords and usernames aren’t going to remember themselves (and if you’re using a password manager, that’s just another subscription to pay).</li>
</ul>
<p>The moral of the story here is that small things add up to big frustrations. Since software developers want to make sure you have the best possible experience using their software, it makes sense to stick to a single software ecosystem.</p></div>

<p>In general, it’s better to have a simpler workflow that incorporates fewer standalone pieces of software and processes. New employees can get the hang of things much quicker, and there’s less room to make the kind of mistakes mentioned above.</p>
<p>But most importantly, scaling your business with integrated all-in-one software is miles easier. If a new engineer joins your team, you’ve only got to worry about adding a single extra account to your subscription. Everything will work seamlessly as before, and you can start to focus on the benefit, rather than complications, of having a new set of hands around to help.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_17 et_pb_equal_columns">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless gas engineers want to start their own business. The flexibility on offer is next to none, and it can be incredibly rewarding to watch your business grow and succeed as a direct result of your own hard work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a trade off. Handling every aspect of your business yourself takes lots of time, making it hard to maintain a good work-life balance. You’ve got to juggle paperwork, marketing, and admin duties that can easily take away from other aspects of your life. At the same time, you’re competing with bigger and well-established brands that have more time, money, and people at their disposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently spoke to Richie Basquine about his experience running RJ Heating &#8211; his own sole trader heating and plumbing business. Managing a work-life balance was one of the topics we covered. It&#8217;s something he deals with every day and something we at Gas Engineer Software actively try to solve with our platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article discusses the 3 reasons why finding a work-life balance is hard as a sole trader and offers some useful recommendations. Let&#8217;s begin with the most obvious reason:</span></p></div>
			</div>
			</div>
				
				
				
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_18 et_pb_equal_columns">
				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_18  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_30 fluid-text  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>Wearing multiple hats </b></h2></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_31 fluid-text  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike bigger companies who can bring in specialists for each department, sole traders have to handle each and every aspect of their business. Richie started his company during the height of the recent pandemic, and learned a lot about working alone the hard way: “you have to find that balance of spreading yourself everywhere &#8211; but not too thin. I have to wear every hat &#8211; I’m doing the invoice, ordering, the job, diary management, you name it… social media, marketing, everything falls on me too”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite having close to two decades of experience as a gas engineer, all these other aspects of running a business were new to Richie. Starting a sole tradership presents a steep learning curve towards the beginning. Often, there simply isn’t enough time to handle every aspect within the hours of, say, 9-5. The actual jobs end up filling much of this time, and you get home to be faced with all the rest &#8211; paperwork, marketing, tax, and so on. </span></p></div>

			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_35 fluid-text  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another problem faced by gas engineer sole traders is that they’re directly competing with larger heating and plumbing businesses. Many feel an underlying pressure to offer the same services as these companies but, as a sole trader, their resources are limited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The newer the business, the harder it is. Jobs come in at all kinds of hours, and I’ve got to go do it. I need that work because I need the money, and because I need the customer, I need the word-of-mouth, and I need the recommendation going forward”, says Richie. He elaborates on the point by saying: “you need to offer that service because the bigger companies do offer 24 hour service. You already set yourself kind of at a disadvantage if you don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seasonal influxes of work play a role in this as well. While a larger company might be able to hire additional help to handle the winter boom, sole traders don’t have the same luxury. It’s a balancing act: “In winter it’s a lot harder, but summer is fine &#8211; people are happy to wait.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the nature of being a sole trader means you can offer a much more personalised and overall better service than these bigger companies. “It’s hard to get that balance”, he mentions, “but hopefully the goal is year on year, the business starts to look after itself and then you can focus on more important things.” </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the trades world, strong customer relationships are absolutely essential. The benefit of prioritising existing customers over new ones is an area well-studied and documented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for sole traders, this can make life a bit more stressful. There’s a fine line between jobs and customers, with the latter representing what could be year after year of reliable work. “Because your business relies on things like word of mouth…it&#8217;s the fear of letting someone down. There will be times like a Sunday afternoon when someone calls you”, Richie explains: “If I don&#8217;t go, then I lose that customer”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his eyes, there’s a fairly simple explanation for this. “Naturally, a lot of people will just use the last person they used unless they had a bad experience. They could be completely happy with you up until then. But because you weren&#8217;t available at that time and if the next person’s done a great service for them – or a decent service even –  they think “oh, just call that guy we got last time.”” With such high stakes, many sole traders feel like they can’t ever relax and that they’re always on the job. </span></p></div>

We offer <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">features</a> that help <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/blog/switch-from-paper-to-software-certificates/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reduce the burden of paperwork</a>, <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/blog/customer-relationship-management-how-to-show-you-care/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">strengthen customer relationships</a>, and offer a service that outshines your competition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Software] does help with the work life balance…everything’s there, nice and accessible”, says Richie. As well as our core features, smaller things like transferring analyser readings to his phone make a significant difference to his day, too: “in an ideal world, with eight services a day, that 3 or 4 minutes turns into 25 minutes.”</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re your own boss, work-life balance is always going to be tricky. This is especially true nowadays with our smartphones – the very things which make being a tradesperson easier – further blurring the line between work and personal time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you really going to let that phone call go unanswered just because it&#8217;s after your “work hours&#8221;? What if it’s the start of a long-lasting and profitable client relationship? And, if you turn your phone off, what jobs might you miss that are now being taken on by your competitors?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are all questions that run through the minds of sole traders after hours. But at the end of the day, a line needs to be drawn somewhere in the sand. Having your own heating and plumbing business can be an extremely rewarding journey filled with success, but it&#8217;s crucial to utilise all the tools and resources available to make the best possible use of your time. </span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business grows and evolves, so do its challenges and needs: <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/blog/from-employee-to-sole-trader/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The tools and processes used by a sole trader</a> should be vastly different to that of a team of engineers and admin staff. </span></p>
<p>The difficulty is that it&#8217;s not always easy to predict needs before they&#8217;re <em>actually needed.</em> In an ideal world, you want to be proactive rather than reactive. In other words, it&#8217;s best to implement changes before and as you grow, not<em> </em>after.</p>
<p>This article will help describe the various stages of growth a heating and plumbing company might go through, as well as its core challenges and needs along the way. Hopefully it will provide some insight into what comes next and what you should be preparing for.</p>
<p><strong>To start, let&#8217;s classify the 3 main stages of growth: </strong></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_promo_description"><div><p style="text-align: left;"><b><i>1.       Starting out as a sole trader.</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all gas engineers begin their business as a sole trader. This means you do all the jobs and most (if not all) of the paperwork yourself. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><i>2.      Hiring your first engineer.</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As businesses mature and start finding more work, working with another engineer can help spread the workload and increase capacity. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><i></i><b><i>3.      Hiring your first admin staff. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more employees and more jobs comes more paperwork that requires dedicated admin staff to handle.</span></p></div></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting your own business is a huge milestone, and many never look back. You get the freedom to do things your way, choose what jobs to take, and run your business how you like. But this extra freedom comes at a cost. </span> </div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By far the biggest challenge of being a sole trader is having to juggle so many roles. You’ve got to handle all your usual gas engineer responsibilities alongside being a salesperson, administrator, accountant, and marketer. This makes time one of your most valuable resources, and work-life balance tricky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other big challenge for sole traders appears when all this hard work pays off: it’s difficult to recognise when it’s time to expand your business and get the help you need to see it grow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of these challenges, many of the needs of a sole trader business are related to saving time, reducing the burden of paperwork, and simplifying business-related tasks. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sole traders each have their own way of running their business &#8211; as is part of the attraction &#8211; but they are all still fundamentally the same. The next big leap comes when you recognise you need help to complete jobs and hire an engineer. This could mean you’ve been turning down work, working overtime, or having to cut some corners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, your job becomes two-sided. While you still get hands-on with jobs, you’re now also in charge of an employee and need to manage their time as well as your own. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted, time will always be an issue &#8211; but you should hopefully have less busy days after hiring a new employee. The three main challenges in this stage come in the form of increased responsibility, maintaining your business’ reputation, and effective team communication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the systems, processes and tools required at this stage are centred around the transition from working alone to with a partner. </span></p></div>

<li style="margin-bottom: 13px;"><b>Training new employees: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tools and processes to help them get the hang of things quickly and efficiently and hit the ground running.

<li style="margin-bottom: 13px;"><b>A system for delegation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you can decide how best to allocate tasks. You and your new employee may have areas of expertise and specialties. If so, make sure to factor this into task allocation. </span></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 13px;"><b>Quality control measures: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep up the reputation you’ve earned for your business, you need to make sure that your new employee understands what’s expected. </span></li>

This is what we classify as the third stage of growth. </span> </div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a doubt, the two greatest challenges of running a fully-fledged company like this is retaining quality and diversifying your skillset. This is because trades businesses depend so much on their reputation and long-term customer relationships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you grow, you need to ensure all your employees are representing your brand name to your standards. Meanwhile, you’ll be practising less hands-on gas engineer skills now. Instead, you’ll have to learn how to run a business and be an entrepreneur. </span></p></div>

Software integrations are a big help, bridging the gap between field and office teams for things like data entry. </span></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 13px;"><b>Reporting: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a manager and business leader, it will benefit you greatly to have insights into financials, job performance, and more to help identify areas for growth and improvement. These reports can help condense vague ideas into something digestible and useful. </span></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 13px;"><b>Organised <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/integrations/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">record keeping</a>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A bigger business means more customer data, records, and certificates to handle. A detailed, organised, and cloud-based system is a must for modern day businesses to avoid things getting lost and make them easily accessible. </span></li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 13px;"><b>Advanced scheduling and workflow analysis:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To ensure you are using your employees time efficiently and workloads are balanced appropriately. Cloud-based scheduling also means that all team members can have access to calendars that update in realtime. </span></li>

You’ll need a system in place so all team members can contribute to long-term and healthy client relationships. This may include keeping customers up to date on job progress, handling complaints, implementing feedback, and more. </span></li>
<li><b></b><b>Quality control &amp; performance tracking:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To ensure each team member is upholding the brand name and contributing appropriately to its success. This is more about checking whether they have everything they need and the right mindset to actually do the job right. Issues that require extra visits damage your company’s reputation and cost far more than spending a little extra time in the first place.</span></li>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business is only as healthy as its relationship with its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is true of all companies, but is perhaps most pronounced in the trade industries. As a home service provider, you aren’t selling a one-time purchase product, and you aren’t selling a subscription-based service either. Instead, you’ve got to work for your customer’s repeat business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The catch is that they’re under no obligation to book with your company again. They’ll only do so if they’re happy with your service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look at any successful heating and plumbing company, you’ll see they have a solid relationship with their customers. They work hard and strive to do the best job they can because they understand that customer happiness is what keeps the cogs turning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what exactly can you do to improve your relationship with your customers? How can you show you care about doing a good job and become their go-to engineer? Here are our 10 tips: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This seems like an obvious one, which is probably also why so many gloss over the topic. Communicating well with a customer means more than sending a booking confirmation and <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/estimate-quotes-invoices/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">invoice</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to talk about your <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/blog/are-you-charging-enough/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">pricing</a>, the scope of the job, time frame, and every stage in clear detail. Transparency is something that customers truly appreciate. You could even go one step further and start explaining what it is you’re actually doing for them &#8211; which is best done in layman’s terms. </span></p></div>

A quick reminder lets customers know that you’re keeping track of the safety of their boiler &#8211; which is one less thing for them to worry about. Not to mention, landlords have a legal obligation to get their boilers serviced once per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, these reminders help your business effortlessly book more jobs &#8211; especially if you offer some kind of discount with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to send out service reminders is to automate them using software. This will ensure they’re always sent out on time and no customers are ever missed &#8211; all while taking next to no effort on your end. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messy and disorganised databases (typically those using paper) make it hard to find customer details when you need them. We recommend having <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/customer-relationship-management/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">one single and consolidated location for all customer information</a>. This will ensure that you and any of your employees can access it quickly and easily (especially when a customer calls). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your database could also include more than simply names and addresses. Take the opportunity to jot down customer preferences or notes on previous jobs which will help you offer a better and more personalised service. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your customers are paying for a service, and they want to feel valued. One of the best ways to show that you care about your customers is to listen to their concerns and needs, and find the best solution for them. This might take a little bit of extra time, but you have a much higher chance of cultivating a long-lasting and fruitful relationship with the customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could consider having special arrangements for elderly customers, landlords with several properties, or simply be understanding and accommodating to changes in scheduling or job scope. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the trades, it’s notoriously difficult to plan time. This is especially true for jobs later in the day when if even just a single job runs over time you’ll be knocked back for the rest of the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trick here is to make sure you’re being realistic. Instead of telling your customer you’ll arrive at 2:00pm, give them a range. For example, saying 2:00 to 2:30pm means you can be up to 30 minutes “late” without having broken your promise to your customer. At the end of the day, it’s all about meeting their expectations, and therefore setting them appropriately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relating back to point #1, be sure to communicate with your customer if you are running late. Letting them know what’s happened (even if it&#8217;s just traffic) and when you expect to arrive means they don’t have to sit around waiting for you.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People love it when they feel like a valued customer, and there’s probably no better way to do this than <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/blog/from-employee-to-sole-trader/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">going the extra mile</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, rather than doing the bare minimum and giving them nothing to complain about, do your absolute best work and give them a reason to rave about you. This could mean cleaning up properly after your job, patching up some paintwork that’s been damaged or weathered, and anything else that springs to mind while on the job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general gist here is to do things that you don’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do, but know will help your customer and won’t take too much of their time. For the small things, you may choose to mention them to your customer but not add them to the invoice. This is a clear indication that your goal is to do the best job, not just to earn a quick buck. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gas industry especially is always changing. New regulations and requirements are frequent, and it’s important to keep up to date with them to make sure you’re doing safe, legal work. </span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing strategy plays a huge role in the success of your business, and it’s important to be both fair and transparent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, you want to make a living without charging so much you struggle to justify it or find customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, and perhaps more importantly, you need to be able to explain why your prices are what they are. Charging higher labour costs comes with an expectation for higher quality work, while a detailed breakdown in estimates, quotes, and invoices help customers understand where their money is going. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently wrote an <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/blog/are-you-charging-enough/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">article about pricing</a> and whether gas businesses are charging their customers enough. Using data from our software, we broke down the average prices by region for common jobs. It should give you a good idea of whether you’re under (or over) pricing your services, and what this means for your business. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking your customers for feedback is a great way to understand what you could be doing better. The simple act of asking them shows that you truly care about your customers and want to provide the best service possible. You may choose to simply ask them after the job, or send out an email survey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important part is then to apply relevant feedback into your workflow. Next time you do a job for that customer, they’ll notice the difference, enjoy the improved service, and respect your effort. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-term relationships are great for any business. Striving to create them is another way you can show your customers you care about them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways you can do this, some more abstract than others. For example, all of the above contribute to forming fruitful long-term relationships in some way or another. But you could also think about introducing loyalty programmes (such as a discounted rate if servicing your own work) or even partnerships with local businesses and agencies. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a gas engineering business is more than being a good gas engineer. You’ve got to be able to put yourself in your customers’ shoes to understand how to provide the best service possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing so will help you generate long-lasting relationships with these customers which, in turn, means you can run a more profitable, streamlined, and time-efficient business. With a loyal customer base ready to recommend your services, you’ll have much more time to focus on more important things like your service quality and personal time. In other words, it’s a self-fuelling and healthy cycle for your business. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many gas engineers dream of starting their own business and becoming a sole trader. Being your own boss has plenty of alluring benefits and can be incredibly rewarding, but it’s not always a walk in the park. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll know all the tips and tricks of the trade from your experience working in the gas industry, but running a business requires you to handle several other aspects at the same time. From scheduling to customer management, accounting, tax, and lots more, the extra freedom comes with added responsibilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was one of the topics we recently talked about with Dean Jones from Jones the Gas. He’s packed with stories, knowledge, and advice from his 20 years of experience working as a gas engineer, first with British Gas but now as a sole trader. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout our chat, he offered some great advice to fellow sole traders, what it means to be running your own business, and how it’s different from being an employee in a larger firm.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial success of a sole tradership often depends on how well the engineer can adapt to a new working environment. The jobs are of course no different, but with all the business responsibilities on your shoulders, it’s important to keep tabs on everything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Dean said, “When you’re employed by someone, generally you’re working 9 till 5 or 8 till 4. Whatever hours you’re doing, when you finish work &#8211; you finish work and you can go home…Whereas when you work for yourself, it really is like 24/7”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have to deal with all the marketing, accounting, and business side of things yourself, it can be difficult to balance. On one hand, you&#8217;ve got to continue doing jobs to make money, but on the other, these business responsibilities simply can&#8217;t be ignored. However, he does note that “it gives you a little bit more freedom”. You won’t have a boss over your shoulder, and you can make your own decisions even if ultimately, as he says, “all your customers are your bosses”.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an employee, you can largely stick to your lane and do your job. But as a business owner and sole trader, far more decisions are on your plate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will make mistakes doing this, but it’s all part of the process. Even the most successful of gas engineering business owners have made missteps, but it&#8217;s how they’ve adapted that ultimately determines their success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From all his years in the industry, Dean mentioned one thing which stuck with him from his days of being an apprentice that’s really helped him. He was told “not to work for anyone else that’s making money from you… Don’t work for letting agents, don’t work for builders, and choose your landlords very carefully”. He also advised new sole traders to “stay away from all the lead generation companies where you pay them a monthly subscription for jobs and leads”. The underlying story here is to try and build a self-sustaining business which can weather a storm or two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as this, he also brought up his experience handling business tax for the first time: “I was going full steam ahead thinking I was earning loads of money…but at the end of my first year trading, I had a huge tax bill. It was hard, hard work paying that off”. His key takeaway from this experience? “If anyone else wants to set up on their own, get a good accountant and get some solid advice”. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the trades, you have a uniquely close relationship with your customers. Any installation, repair, and servicing is your craftsmanship. Completing top-tier jobs will reflect positively on your business, so long as you can afford to spend the time on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most engineers working in larger companies have tight schedules they need to stick to. In contrast, running your own business gives you the freedom and flexibility to do everything exactly how you want. Without managers to please and job quotas to fill, you’ve only got to worry about your customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Dean, it’s important to go the extra mile and finish jobs that his customers truly appreciate. “We’ve had a few [jobs] recently where we’ve taken the boiler off the wall, and it’s been bad behind it. So we plastered the wall, painted it, and tidied it up”. His customer was so happy with the job that they teared up. “You can’t get any better than that”, he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might not pay off immediately, but in Dean’s experience, having happy customers is more than worthwhile. His customers regularly return for repeat business because of his quality of work. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fliers, leaflets, digital advertisements, social media, directories &#8211; they’re all great ways to get more customers. But nothing comes close to a trusted recommendation. Largely due to his attitude to his craftsmanship, Dean has been able to leverage word-of-mouth marketing to his advantage: “I’ve got a real loyal army of customers. As soon as someone asks to recommend a gas engineer or someone who can fit a boiler &#8211; they say Jones the Gas”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not necessarily the intention, his quality craftsmanship has undeniably helped Dean grow his business to what it is today. In fact, it leads us perfectly on to what he said was one of his biggest frustrations growing a gas engineering business: turning down work. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a sole trader, it’s crucial to be able to effectively manage your time. This isn’t just inclusive of making a <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/scheduling/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">schedule</a> which you can stick to &#8211; it’s knowing when to say no to a job, and how to handle such a situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Dean’s business is so packed with jobs (especially around winter) that he can’t always accommodate the amount of work coming in. He’s sometimes forced to tell customers that he’s fully booked up for the next couple of months, and won’t be able to do the job. He could always say yes to these customers, but then he would be squeezing in too much work to do at a standard he’s happy with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are ways to solve this problem, though. He emphasised the importance of “good accounting, good software, and good tools”, but also simply recognised the need for an extra set of hands. He said that he “had to try and do something to expand the business”, but that it was important to find “the quality and calibre of an engineer who will carry your name and do work for you”. Pricing strategy is another element to consider, too. Higher-priced services generally get fewer customers, but make more profit (within reason, of course). </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming a sole trader is a huge step forward for gas engineers who want to better shape their own career. The extra freedom means you can run your business how you prefer, spend time where you think most valuable, and cultivate a loyal customer base. The whole process can be extremely rewarding, but it also comes with some serious hard work. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you ask gas engineers what their biggest problems are, a few answers will keep popping up. “Not having enough time to do the job”, “finding more customers”, “chasing outstanding invoices” are a few examples, and they’re all legitimate issues that gas engineers face when running their business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having spent the past 12 years optimising our software and working with fellow gas engineers, we’ve come to the conclusion that a simple reminder can be all your business needs to push that customer to pay or to book a new job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually sending them</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Giving reminders to hundreds if not thousands of clients manually is an insanely difficult task. How do you know which invoices haven’t been paid, and how do you keep track of everyone’s boilers to know when to issue a service reminder?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is automating the process with <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/automated-reminders/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">automated reminders</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will delve deep into the topic and explore 4 of the biggest benefits of sending automated reminders. But before we begin, let&#8217;s take a step back: </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_promo_description"><h5 class="et_pb_module_header">What are automated reminders?</h5><div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An <strong><a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/automated-reminders/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">automated reminder</a></strong> is a message sent out at a specified time. The most common and useful are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Service reminders</strong> for customers that need a (usually annual) servicing of boilers, for example.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Invoice reminders</strong> to confirm receipt of the invoice, keep track of unpaid invoices, and settle payments.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Quote reminders</strong> to remind customers, confirm receipt of a quote you sent, and encourage bookings. </span></li>
</ul></div></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most important thing about automated service reminders is that they target your existing customers. It’s been proven time and time again that business owners should prioritise their existing customers for several reasons: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re easier to book jobs for</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They appreciate working with a gas engineer they know they can trust</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know they aren’t problematic customers (late payers, extremely demanding, hovering over your shoulder, etc)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re already set up in your system</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to spend money advertising to find them</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, sending out these service reminders can make it appear like you genuinely care and are being helpful &#8211; after all, your customers who are landlords have a legal obligation to get their boiler serviced every year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as this, quote reminders can help encourage potential customers to book a job with you. It’s not uncommon for customers to ask around for different quotes, and staying in contact can give off a great impression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending automatic reminders is a great way to effortlessly capture more work for your business. Based on user feedback and inhouse data, we can confidently say automated reminders are our most profitable feature for this reason. Not to mention &#8211; automating the process leaves you with much more time to focus on what really counts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings us nicely onto our next point: </span></p></div>

			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_111 fluid-text  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">37.5% of our users said that before using our software they sent out manual service reminders. For all these gas engineers, it’s proven an important part of their business. Meanwhile, payment reminders are done by just about every gas engineer and take up completely unnecessary hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By automating the process, they’re simply taking it to the next level and are able to significantly cut down on tedious, time-consuming work. Instead, they can focus their time on work that counts, is billable, and get much more done with less staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the question is one of wasting your time on tasks that could be done by software, or spending it where it counts. In fact, many of our customers that have recently started a gas engineering business say that automated reminders are a great way to smoothen the transition from employee to business owner. Automated reminders help them gain a steady flow of jobs without much thought, and leave them to focus on the job rather than business-related tasks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But having reminders sent out automatically doesn’t just save your time: It makes you look like you’ve got everything together. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s practically impossible to send out reminders manually on a tight schedule. Between your jobs, scheduling, accounting tasks, and more, reminders are rarely at the top of your list. Reminders that are sent out late (or even not at all) are far less useful for your customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a gas engineer that sends out a service reminder only a few days before the required service date might not be able to schedule a job in time for the customer. In that case, they’ll have to look for someone else to do the job. Likewise, payment reminders are difficult to keep track of and often forgotten &#8211; meaning you go unpaid for much longer than necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automating the process means you’re able to reliably send out reminders at a specified time &#8211; such as 1 month before a required servicing or 2 weeks after you’ve sent the invoice. Being timely with each reminder radiates professionalism and that your business is organised and ready to do a good job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, using software like Gas Engineer Software lets you customise reminder templates to say what you want and include logos. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A regular cash flow is critical for your gas engineering business. Everything from holidays to new employees and even new equipment rely on having enough cash in the bank at the end of each month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, not all of your customers will pay on time. But that doesn’t mean you can’t send out reminders to dramatically reduce this number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, all that’s happened is your invoice got buried under something else. A gentle reminder sent after a certain time has passed (often 2 weeks) is usually enough to get the invoice paid and money into your account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main difficulty of sending payment reminders is easily seeing which invoices have yet to be paid. Software that can send automated reminders can easily access this data and do it without a second thought. </span></p></div>

<p>We’ve noticed two distinct characteristics that separate successful businesses from the rest:</p>
<p><strong>    1.     &#8211;     </strong>The majority of those earning an above-average revenue perhead are charging more than the median for individual tasks. Meanwhile, those charging well below the median earn far less.</p>
<p>The fact that the companies that charge slightly more can still fill their calendars suggests that a significant portion of gas engineers under-price their services.</p>
<p><strong>    2.     &#8211;     </strong> Running an organised company that does the basics well helps to provide real value to customers and sets you up to charge a premium.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever thought about how much time you spend using different software solutions for your work? </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">For gas engineers (and other trades, too) there’s a world far removed from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actual work.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That world includes everything from accounting to tax, scheduling, invoices and more &#8211; and it takes up a good chunk of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most of these tasks, gas engineers use software to make their lives easier. You’ve got accounting software like Xero, Safe, or Quickbooks, flue gas analysers from Kane and Anton, and maybe even payment software like Stripe or Crezco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can almost feel like all these solutions, while helpful on their own, amount to an insane amount of login details to remember and software to learn. Ditching them isn’t exactly an option, though, since doing everything on paper takes even longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instead, the solution is to combine them under one roof. We call this software integration and it’s a blessing for gas engineers that just want to get on with the job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article will give you an introduction to software integration and discuss key benefits that make it so crucial for any serious gas engineer these days. Let’s get started. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software integration simply means connecting two or more pieces of software together to create a single, unified system. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This way, they can exchange information, be operated from a single login, and help you run a more streamlined and productive business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, it’s no different to how many gas engineers venture into the plumbing world. From their point of view, plumbing is a great way to get more business alongside their gas work. For the customers, it saves them time having to find a separate tradesperson. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_promo_description"><h5 class="et_pb_module_header">Quick note:</h5><div><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Integration” does not mean “replace”. Integrating software means you are still using two or more pieces of software, just from one control panel. This is not the same as how Gas Engineer Software replaces WhatsApp and Google Calendar, for example, as scheduling systems. In this case, you no longer need to use them at all.</span></div></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software integration requires a partnership between companies. This is actually quite common, as it benefits all involved. Once this has been done, the software providers will do all the hard work.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have integrated your software, they will be able to communicate, exchange data, and run core features without you having to constantly log into other accounts. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a few key benefits doing it this way: </span>  </p>
<p><b>#1: It saves you lots of time</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than having to remember countless login details for all your software accounts, you can handle everything you need on a daily basis from one place. That means fewer annoying logins, lost passwords, and issues with access rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most importantly &#8211; integration means saving hours of time on mundane data entry. Data from invoices and payments is needed for your tax returns, while client information is needed across almost every stage. Ordinarily, you would have to manually enter or port this data over from one software to another. What is otherwise a lengthy and tedious task is transformed into a click of a button. </span>  </p>
<p><b>#2: It reduces human error</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’ve got several different pieces of software that need access to the same information, your data has to be accurate. This brings us nicely to the second issue that software integration solves: It completely eliminates the change of human error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This offers two main benefits. Firstly, it means you won’t have to spend even more time going back to find and edit the mistake. Secondly, it offers you complete peace of mind and validation that your data is 100% accurate. </span>  </p>
<p><b>#3:  It streamlines business processes</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With your different software accounts integrated, invoices, customer information, and more are readily available for your accountants. Without the need for manual data entry, they’ll spend far less time on your accounts &#8211; which means they’ll bill you less, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, your entire business will enjoy the convenience and speed of having data in one centralised location. Less time spent finding information, doing admin tasks, and teaching new staff is always a good thing for your business. And with this system you’ll find you can easily automate invoicing, payment reminders, service reminders, and much more.</span>  </p>
<p><b>#4: It allows staff to focus on core tasks</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is a bit of a cliché, time is your most valuable resource. As a business owner, you want to be spending your time where it matters the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time saved and efficiency offered by software integrations lets you focus on core tasks that directly contribute to the success of your company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have staff, they’ll feel the benefits too: rather than doing tedious data entry tasks and wasting time switching between different software, they can focus on customer service and other income-generating work. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realistically, this all depends on the software you are using. Most software integrations revolve around accounting and payment, as the financial side of things is often left to dedicated software.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Gas Engineer Software has integration with QuickBooks, Sage, and Xero. We’re also working on integration with Crezco to make payments a simpler and more convenient process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also marketing tools like Mailchimp that benefit greatly from integration. Connecting your Gas Engineer Software account to Mailchimp lets you leverage the wealth of information contained in your customer database for marketing purposes. So, if you had plans to send out special offers or emails to your customers, this is how to do it. </span></p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, software companies want to make it as easy as possible for their customers (you) to reap the benefits of their platform. By simplifying the process down to the click of a button, you’re able to consolidate all your different software platforms into one single and easy-to-use platform that helps you save time and focus on what counts. </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a gas engineer, life is always on the move. From home to the office and one customer to the next, it can seem like you never spend more than a couple of hours in one place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But sitting at a desk all day doesn’t suit everyone and, for many, this is a huge perk of the job. Although, most will admit it can make it a little harder to stay organised when you’ve got pieces of paper flying around your van, office, and home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misplacing a schedule or job sheet is one thing &#8211; but a certificate is another. Losing one can be a huge headache. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, we live in a day and age where there’s a digital solution for just about anything. Going paperless with your <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/records-certificates/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gas safe certificates</a> means saving precious time: Time that you could be investing into more important aspects of your business or with friends and family.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gas safe certificates are a staple part of the job. Even if they’re pretty standard and straightforward to complete, the frequency at which they’re done is reason enough to justify a new and more efficient workflow. In fact, we recently sent out a survey to our customers where 53% responded saying our <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/software/records-certificates/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">digital records &amp; certificates</a> save them more time than any other feature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s break down the benefits into 3 key areas:</span></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_divider_49 et_pb_space et_pb_divider_hidden"><div class="et_pb_divider_internal"></div></div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_149 fluid-text  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">

			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_150 fluid-text  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filling out a standard gas safe certificate might take 20-30 minutes if done on paper (including the time needed to print, send or deliver it to your customer, and keep a record for yourself).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digitally, it’s far easier and takes only a fraction of the time. Many fields are pre-filled with information the software already knows (think your company details, customer addresses, and more). Meanwhile, distributing is done at the click of a button, and you can send as many copies as necessary. </span></div>

The advantage of having the software is that it&#8217;s all instant and sent directly to the customer. You&#8217;ve not got to worry about keeping or losing paper copies and you can go back to previous certificates from last week, last month, or three years prior. It&#8217;s always going to be there and it&#8217;s very easy to access all of that information.”</span> </div></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you&#8217;re meticulously organised, paper certificates are easy to lose. You also have no control over whether your customers are going to lose their copy and ask for another. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital certificates in this sense are far more secure. Storing them via the cloud means you’ll always have access to them as and when needed. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there&#8217;s also the fact that that digital certificates are guaranteed easy to read. Handwriting is often barely legible even before you add on the trouble caused by smudges, water damage, and faint carbon copies. If your customer can&#8217;t read it, they&#8217;ll just ask you for another copy.  </span></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a software company, we’re well aware of how daunting the prospect of transitioning from paper to software </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sounds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, the process is simple and straightforward. But don’t take our word for it &#8211; from the same survey we sent our users: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">72% were running their business on paper before using our software</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">68% had fully adapted to using our software within 1 week, and 92% within a month. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transition from paper to software does not require any specialist knowledge and can be done by anyone. The reason for this is that any good software company makes it their mission for their software to be intuitive and simple to use. </span></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your customer does want a paper copy, you can always print the digital version and there’s no real difference. All the fields and information on them are identical &#8211; whether paper or electronic. The only difference is it&#8217;s far easier to customise them with your logo and company details. </span> </div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 Years of old paper records should still be kept until they become obsolete and old enough you no longer need them. There’s no need to retroactively create a digital version of your entire company’s records, though. Rather, the new digital ones effectively mark a new era in your company’s workflow. If you need to find a record before the date you started completing them digitally, you know to look in your paper filing cabinets.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This ensures a seamless transition. Eventually you will completely phase out paper records. </span></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than having to manually organise all your records and certificates in binders, there are far more efficient ways to do it digitally. For example, <a href="https://swfylive.wpenginepowered.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Gas Engineer Software</a> automatically stores records under customer details. This way, any record is simple and intuitive to find when you need it &#8211; simply search for the customer name, address, or job number. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, this takes zero physical space and they can be accessed anywhere, at any time. </span> </div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, paper solutions are becoming rapidly obsolete. Yes, everything </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> still be done on paper &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t mean that it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sticking to this outdated way of doing business is taking up hours of your time each week, and causing constant organisational headaches for many. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve discussed, there are three key benefits to issuing certificates digitally: Time, ease, and organisation. But most importantly, making the transition has proven to be simple and seamless even for those who don’t consider themselves tech-savvy. </span></div>
